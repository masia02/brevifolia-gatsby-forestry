But the walking of which I speak has nothing in it akin to taking exercise, as it is called, as the sick take medicine at stated hours,–as the swinging of dumb-bells or chairs; but is itself the enterprise and adventure of the day. If you would get exercise, go in search of the springs of life. Think of a man’s swinging dumb-bells for his health, when those springs are bubbling up in far-off pastures unsought by him!

Moreover, you must walk like a camel, which is said to be the only beast which ruminates when walking. When a traveller asked Wordsworth’s servant to show him her master’s study, she answered, “Here is his library, but his study is out of doors.

太陽が照り、風がやや吹いていれば、知的成長と道徳的成長に重要な影響をより受けやすくなるでしょう。間違いなく、厚くて薄い肌を正しくプロポーションするのはいいことです。しかし、十分な速さで落ちるスカーフであるmethinks –自然の治療法は、夜が昼に耐える割合、冬から夏に感じる割合で見つかるはずです。私たちの思考には、より多くの空気と太陽の光があります。労働者の無骨な手のひらは、怠惰のだらしない指よりも、その感動が心臓を刺激する、自尊心と英雄主義のより細かい組織に精通しています。それは、日焼けして横たわり、日焼けやカルスの経験から遠く離れた、自分自身を白と考える単なる感傷です。

When we walk, we naturally go to the fields and woods: what would become of us, if we walked only in a garden or a mall? Even some sects of philosophers have felt the necessity of importing the woods to themselves, since they did not go to the woods. “They planted groves and walks of Platanes,” where they took _subdiales ambulationes_ in porticos open to the air. Of course it is of no use to direct our steps to the woods, if they do not carry us thither. I am alarmed when it happens that I have walked a mile into the woods bodily, without getting there in spirit. In my afternoon walk I would fain forget all my morning occupations and my obligations to society. But it sometimes happens that I cannot easily shake off the village. The thought of some work will run in my head, and I am not where my body is,–I am out of my senses. In my walks I would fain return to my senses.
